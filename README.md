This is a fork of Henning Schaefer's SEOTools module for <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.org"><strong>CMS Made Simple</strong></a>&#8482;. It includes

* faster generation of metadata for each page
* various UI polishing (most notably the ability to ignore selected notices)
* support for user-specified keyword separator (default ',')
* support for user-specified keywords, as an alternative to auto-generated ones
* support for extra image-types
* no hard-coded metadata parameters, so it's easy to add/change/remove them
* support for some twitter and googleplus metadata
* bugfixes, including most of those reported to <a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/list/880">CMSMS</a>.

Though this work was started before the <a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/projects/seotools2">SEOTools2 fork</a>, it does include one or two features from that.

This module is suitable for CMSMS from 1.9 to 2.1.x at least.

Further information may be found at the module's <a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/projects/seotools">forge-page</a>.
